# Teaching materials for a macro principles course

These are materials I have developed over three semesters of teaching my macro principles course.

All materials copyright 2021--2022 J. L. Reddinger and licensed as [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Virtually all of my lectures and some of my assignments use recent economic data. For example:
